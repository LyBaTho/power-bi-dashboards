3. **Financial Dashboard**: Tracks revenue, profit, operating margins, and YoY trends to provide a clear financial performance overview.  
4. **Transaction Dashboard**: Analyzes synthetic transaction data across orders, payments, promotions, and customer segments, with RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) insights.  

🎯 These projects demonstrate expertise in:
- Data Modeling (Star Schema, ETL-ready structures)  
- DAX Measures & Time Intelligence (YoY, MoM, rolling averages)  
- Dashboard Design & Storytelling (KPIs, drilldowns, slicers)  
- Business Domains: FMCG, Finance, Content Analytics, E-Commerce
